# Getting Started

## What’s in the Box?
Inside your box you should find the following:


<img src="/images/WIB_UTD.png" width="640" />

- M2 (UTD or UTH)
- 26 pin cable harness kit
- 24 pin cable harness kit (UTH version only)
- Window sticker
- Start up card

## Using your M2

There are many ways you can write code and work with M2. One of the quickest and easiest ways is to use the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is what this documentation will use. Many other development environments work well including [Atmel Studio](http://www.microchip.com/development-tools/atmel-studio-7) and [Simulink®](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html).

The first thing you will need to do is [set up the Arduino IDE](./arduino.md).  After that you might choose to build and run an [existing project](http://showcase.macchina.cc/projects.html) or write something your own.  There are many [libraries available for the M2](http://showcase.macchina.cc/libraries.html) and most include examples sketchs that you can run on your M2.

## Enclosures

It is ok to do some initial setup before you have an enclosure, but before your M2 spends long periods in the car please consider protecting it. We have a few configurations of enclosures designed and ready for 3D printing. You can download the designs, tweak them as needed, print, share, lather, rinse, repeat.

Find more about enclosures [here](../technical-references/enclosures.md).
